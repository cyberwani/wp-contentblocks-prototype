wp-contentblocks-prototype
==========================

My personal prototyping repo for help developing Content Blocks feature for Wordpress-UI group.

###Updates so far:

- 09/09/2013: added initial templates for each content block type;
- 09/07/2013: added initial UI for content block selection;
- 09/06/2013: added Sortable jQuery UI plugin, with basic functionality to sort blocks;
- 09/05/2013: added initial files;

###Todo

- Create a collection of Block models, each model is a different Block type, and their respective view's templates;
- Improve sortable functions to handle side-by-side content blocks, columns, etc;
- implement editor capability for the Blocks (suggestion: etch.js plugin);
- UI improvements (handles, transitions, etc);
- Create a Backbone collection of block models;
- Develop a way to handle columns (inspiration: Squarespace UI for page editing);
